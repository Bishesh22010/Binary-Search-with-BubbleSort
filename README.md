# Binary-Search-with-BubbleSort

Overview--
This C++ program demonstrates the implementation of binary search on an array after sorting it using the bubble sort algorithm. Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array, and bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm.

Prerequisites --
Before you can run this program, you need the following:

-- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
-- Basic knowledge of C++ programming
-- A code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, or any other)

Usage --
This project of mine can be used for searching a particular integer data in a one dimensional array. And then we can Sort the array in ascending manner with the help of Bubble sort algorithm. It is a very basic program for the usage of college students..

Customization -- 
Feel free to customize this program for your specific needs. You can modify the input data, change the sorting algorithm, or even integrate it into a larger project.

Keep Sharing, Keep Coding :)
